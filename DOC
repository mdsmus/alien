* features
** if lisp file exists will load it by default as example
** examples are lisp files, easy to load and check
** devnote to document where functions came from and what we did to
   them. mainly for cl-dist creators and not for the users
* goals
** reduce symbol conflicts
** be able to use just a single :use :cl-ext (and reduce conflicts)
** easy of use (scripting, etc)
** documentation in one place
* why hand-made documentation?
  - it's easier to use things like sections, subsections
  - superior way of editing documents (using auctex instead of docstrings)
  - documentation in one place (for common lisp, libraries, etc)
* thanks
** many organizational from cltl (order, titles, but no content)
** many things from python documentation project
** docstrings and args from sbcl
