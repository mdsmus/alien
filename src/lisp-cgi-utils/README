This is lisp-cgi-utils, a toolkit for writing CGI applications in Common Lisp.

It consists of two packages:
 - the package HTTP, implemented in the file http.lisp:
   - the basic CGI interface,
   - can send the HTTP headers,
   - can read CGI environment variables,
   - can parse GET/POST CGI parameters and offer easy access to them
 - the package HTML:
   - basic HTML formatting, with support for the most used tags (not yet
     all, will be completed on demand),
   - specialized support function for working with HTML forms,
   - HTTP cookie support

usage:
  - load the HTTP and HTML packages into your Lisp image simply by
    (load "http.lisp")
    (load "html.lisp")

Very simple examples are included in the examples directory.

Notice: When sending cookies, be careful not to put ";" into the cookie
        value as this confuses Microsofts broken browser called
        Internet Explorer. This is also true for Mac OS X Safari and
        Konqueror.
