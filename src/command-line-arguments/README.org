* Tasks

*** TODO add documentation
  Besides the comments in the code.

*** TODO add counter variables
  For verbosity flags: -v -v -v adds 3 to the default value.
  With minimum and maximum value caps in the finalizer.

*** TODO enhance layout of self-documentation
  Have an automatic layout strategy for self-documentation.
  Maybe output the kind of things that man(1) expects, groff(7),
  then actually integrate with the man system.
  Or else, build a general tool to display stuff on a terminal
  while respecting terminal width.
  Or output HTML and use lynx -dump or a browser.
